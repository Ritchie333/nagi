<h3> Description</h3>
NAGI (New Adventure Game Interpreter) is a clone of Sierra's own 
AGI     which   they created and used through the 80's to produce a whole
bunch    of  great  adventure games like Space Quest, Leisure Suit Larry
and Kings     Quest.   NAGI  was created by disassembling the original AGI
executable   and  writing  equivalent C code that would run under <a href="http://www.libsdl.org/">
      SDL which is a free generic  library</a>        for low-level  access 
to graphics and audio.  It can read both v2 and    v3 game data for the PC.<br>
<br>



                  I started working on this (disassembling and learning stuff)
   around    November   1999.  I didn't really do much work on it until the
  start of  2001  when I  finished the picture rendering code.  So I started
  with a program    that draws  agi pics to this...  I actually got the initial
  idea from the    guy who <a href="http://www.digger.org/">    recreated
an  old game called    Digger</a>          .  He did the same thing by disassembling 
  the original game and  recoding    it all in C.<br>
<br>



       The original name for NAGI was GI-Jay.. like GI-Joe only different.&nbsp; 
   It evolved from JayGI.&nbsp; NAGI sounds a bit more sophisticated anyway 
   and can be confused with a <a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/%7Etarinkim/nagi/">
       whole bunch of things</a>!<br>
<br>


From the "3D Animated Adventure Game Reference Card For MS-DOS":<br>
<br>
<i>Sierra's 3D animated adventures represent a totally new approach to computer
gaming -- a third generation in computer adventure.&nbsp; They feature colourful
hi-res graphics, with animated characters moving through three dimensional
background screens.&nbsp; The improved parser lets you talk to the computer in
whole sentences.<br><br>

Sierra's new series of adventures are interactive, changing as you explore
and solve the puzzles.&nbsp; New facets are revealed as you delved into the game.&nbsp;
In fact, you can play the game many times over and never play the same game
twice.</i><br>

<b>January 2nd, 2002</b><br>

<b><br>
December 22nd, 2001</b><br>
OK, I wanted to make one more release before 2002 so here it is. &nbsp;I'm 
sorry for the long wait.. &nbsp;5 months really sucks. &nbsp;There's a few 
warts.. Not everything is complete yet but I've got a bunch of new features 
in this version. &nbsp;Besides the internal cleanup there's:<br>
<ul>
<li>directory search / game selection menu</li><li>CGA emulation</li><li>very responsive key input</li><li>more CRC's for games</li><li>Amiga game support!<br></li>
</ul>

 If you have any comments.. I would love to hear them.. really! &nbsp;I want 
bug reports 'n everything. &nbsp;I'm sorry if I haven't replied to an email. 
&nbsp;I'm pretty sure I've replied to them all. &nbsp;There wasn't that many 
but Hotmail doesn't tell me if I've replied to an email or not.<br>
<br>

 I will add more to this site later on when I have time. &nbsp;Check out
the       <a href="file:///C:/nagi_project/nagi_website/docs.html">docs </a>I'm working on if you want.<br>
<br>
<b>July 21st, 2001<br></b>Check out the <a href="file:///C:/nagi_project/nagi_website/screenshots.html">screenshots section</a>
   for a sneak peak at some of the work I've been doing on CGA dithering. 
&nbsp;It's ultra neat and should give a bit more of a retro-feeling for people 
who didn't have an EGA card when they played these games originally. (like 
me!)<br>
<br>
<b>July 17th 2001<br></b>Added some new <a href="file:///C:/nagi_project/nagi_website/screenshots.html"> screenshots </a>
 for Kings Quest 4. &nbsp;I finally managed to finish it. &nbsp;I had to
make a slight change to NAGI for it to work around one of KQ4's logic bugs
though. &nbsp;This changes the save format again though.. sorry.<br>
<b><br>
   July 16th 2001</b><br>

        Rearranged the site a bit to make it easier to get to some information.<br>

        Check out the <a href="file:///C:/nagi_project/nagi_website/legal.html"> Legal</a>        section because 
it contains some problems on the legal nature of NAGI<br>
<br>

        New version of NAGI is out too! (v2.02) &nbsp;This has multiple savegame 
   support and a bunch of small bug fixes. &nbsp;Check out the <a href="file:///C:/nagi_project/nagi_website/history.html">
       History</a>        and Downloads to find out more.
                                               
      
<h3> Download</h3>

                   The latest version is v2.04. &nbsp;In order to run NAGI
 you   need  the <b>NAGI </b><b>executable</b> and the <a href="http://www.libsdl.org/"><b>
       SDL dynamic linking library</b></a>       . &nbsp;SDL used to be packaged 
with NAGI but this was dodgy and eventually    somebody was going to complain. 
&nbsp;Just copy them both in the same directory    and you should be right.<br>
<br>
<a href="file:///C:/nagi_project/nagi_website/dl/nagi_-_2_04.zip"> NAGI v2.04</a>        - toggle through different renderer modes, menu upgrade, more crc's, fixes<br>
<a href="file:///C:/nagi_project/nagi_website/dl/SDL-1.2.3-win32.zip">SDL DLL v1.2.3</a>        -
