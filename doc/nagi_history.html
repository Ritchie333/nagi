<h3>NAGI History</h3>
                      
<p>??th July 2001 (Version 2.03)<br>
         </p>
                 
<ul>
                                   
  <li>After you give the unicorn to that lotta witch and are flown back to 
    the ground, the game crashes.  This is because a "previous cel frame" 
for    an object is set to a view object that was discarded!!  This caused 
NAGI   to crash.. the original doesn't because it's still lying in memory.. 
but  it's not meant to be. so instead of storing a pointer to the previous 
cel  like sierra did, I changed it to "cel's previous height and width" which
  is all sierra needed the pointer for.  so I replaced a 32bit pointer with
  two 8bit numbers.  However, it does break the savegames :(  which sucks
for  me too.</li>
                           
  <li>Added palettes from Apple ][gs and Apple][.. they were from emulators 
   though.  I might make it a bit more customisable from an ini file</li>
                           
  <li>tidying up animated obj code</li>
                       
  <li>more tidying.. whee</li>
                       
  <li>fixed a bug I introduced in SQ:TLC and others probably in the swirly
   spaceship around planet scene.  force.update wasn't "reading" the parameter.
    In actual truth.. the later agi's just updated them all and ignored the 
 parameter but I forgot to read the parameter anyway in the code cleanup</li>
                       
  <li>fixed up the change loop cmd so it checks the bounds properly.  it
didn't check it if the loop number was just one over the maximum.. this is
a BUG in the ORIGINAL agi too!  sqtlc earlier versions will not run the intro
though</li>
                   
  <li>urgh.. never do:   state.var[*(c++)] = objtable[*(c++)].loop_total; 
   and expect reliable results</li>
               
  <li>profiling and trying to optimise lengthy code.. like lzw, picfill and
  umm.. video scaling.. it's lotsa fun!</li>
           
  <li>replaced picfill's dynamic "stack" (ie a bunch of free's 'n mallocs) 
 with a fixed buffer.. 3k but agi had 2.5k and that was to share with the 
um.. function stack :)</li>
       
  <li>fixed so donald duck has sound</li>
   
  <li>disassmbled CGA driver with dithering.. just have to code it up in C</li>
  <li>added CGA support to NAGI.. looks alright.. need to fix some bugs though..
and make it less hard-coded<br>
         <br>
        <br>
         </li>
                 
</ul>
                 
<p>16th July 2001 (Version 2.02)</p>
                      
<ul>
                                         
  <li>Changed name of Justin's Quest to Justin Quest</li>
                                         
  <li>disassembling savegame stuff</li>
                                         
  <li>fixed keys so you can use the keypad now</li>
                                         
  <li>fixed the keypad 5 when numlock is off.. or was it on?  thanks to Justin</li>
                                         
  <li>try saving a game when the total path size is longer than 32 chars
in the original agi.. urgh</li>
                                         
  <li>fixed a parsing bug thanks to justin.  In justin quest typing 'ie'
gets parsed as 'e'.  the problem was that it was incorrectly detecting single
letter words like 'a' and 'i' (which sierra-agi skips by default)  "a " and
"i " was being detected right but "a&lt;eol&gt;" wasn't	</li>
                                         
  <li>if sound cannot be init'd (ie, if sound is already in use) then it
disables it (Justin suggested this)</li>
                                         
  <li>fixed cmd_log entry in cmd table.. i hadn't specified the 1 parameter
     so kq3 crashed when it tried to log bad parsed cmds in debug mode because
     cmd.log didn't exist but nagi didn't skip it's 1 parameter either</li>
                                         
  <li>tidied up some priority code (misc_graf.c)</li>
                                         
  <li>fixed up flags code so it only used bits for each flag.. not a whole
     byte. reduces save games a bit (256 down to 32 bytes for flags) (so
224    bytes)</li>
                                         
  <li>replaced all hardcoded animated object flags with #defines</li>
                                         
  <li>described all #defined animated flags :)</li>
                                         
  <li>fixed save games so they recognise "c:" or "c:\"  or "a:" or whatever</li>
                                         
  <li>added 'where to get games' and 'funny larry bug' to docs</li>
                                         
  <li>organised docs a bit</li>
                   
</ul>
                       
<p>note: save games are incompatible with older versions now due to several
     changes (in viewtable and state structure)</p>
                      
<p>28th June 2001 (Version 2.01)</p>
                      
<ul>
                                         
  <li>fixed update.screen so SDL wouldn't ignore it if it went slightly offscreen</li>
                                         
  <li>played around with adding buffbri mouse support.. works but I want
to make it more generic</li>
                                         
  <li>changed video mode to use 8bit colour depth.  does it fix anybody's
     colour probs?</li>
                                         
  <li>added proper buff bri support.. access it through standard.ini</li>

  <li>changed some mouse support games in list</li>
                                         
  <li>automouse works! had to play around with sierra's implementation to
     make it work but it works well now.</li>
                                         
  <li>shifted some bugs to games issues (not really bugs)</li>
                   
</ul>
                       
<p>26th June 2001 (Version 2.00)</p>
                      
<ul>
                                         
  <li>finally implemented all v3 differences.. this doesn't include saving
     yet</li>
                                         
  <li>v1.04 was actually feature complete when it came to graphics</li>
                                         
  <li>cmd177, 173 and 181 are done</li>
                                         
  <li>some variables are set and unset.. but nothing actually checks it</li>
                                         
  <li>** some sort of mouse driver maybe checks it??  never actually released?</li>
                                         
  <li>cleaned up command table structure a bit</li>
                                         
  <li>implemented tracing ('+' actually skips to the next logic call)</li>
                                         
  <li>implemented text scrolling (for the tracing)</li>

  <li>tracing fixed up (reading 16bit said numbers was askew and could have
     caused a crash</li>
                                         
  <li>fixed sierra's tracing so it doesn't try and read a null pointer if
     command name does not exist.</li>
                                         
  <li>added all the different tracing "hooks" throughout the code that I
commented out</li>
                                         
  <li>added Schiller Demo to crc list</li>

</ul>
                       
<p>19th June 2001 (Version 1.04)</p>
                      
<ul>

  <li>implemented v3 priority table </li>
                                         
  <li>mysterious movement type 4 which I suspect is for mouse support?</li>
                                         
  <li>kq4 works better now.. no weird priority errors now</li>
                                         
  <li>Set some milestones and gave previous snapshots a version number</li>

  <li>all games in my crc list work.. if you have a game version that isn't

  <li>initial beginnings of a game select menu (hence the NAGI status bar)
     haven't finished it yet because i was working on version detection</li>
